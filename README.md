# Elixir For Lunch

This repository contains concepts and exercises for a weekly Elixir language learning session. The idea is to meet during our lunch break once a week, have a short presentation, then work on some exercises to help us learn Elixir and Functional Programming.  

## Resources
* [Programming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6) - A book by Dave Thomas, also from Pragmatic Bookshelf.  The third edition of this book will be available August 2018, but I am using the second edition as a resource.  
* [Learn Functional Programming with Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/cdc-elixir/learn-functional-programming-with-elixir) - A book from Pragmatic Bookshelf 
* [Etudes for Elixir](https://github.com/oreillymedia/etudes-for-elixir) - A collection of exercises that were written to accompany the book [Introducing Elixir](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030584.do)
